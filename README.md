<h1>A Reactjs Web Site Temple</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is a Reactjs template that builds a functioning web site from a JSON object.  The JSON object contains all the data items (pages, posts, urls, etc.) for the site and the React app builds the site from that.  This is in its initial stages.  There is little here except placeholders.  The data in the JSON (pageData.js) object is dummy info, so that the site will work.  If you choose to use it, you're on your own.</p>
